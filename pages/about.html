    <h1>How is our veterinary clinic different from others?</h1>
    <p>The private veterinary center "Friend" was founded in Kyiv back in 1996. The first steps were timid, but over
        28
        years
        of responsible work we have the main thing - recognition and trust of our clients. Our medical methods and
        approaches,
        management style and level of service are an example for colleagues throughout the country, which they are
        happy
        to use.
        What are our advantages:

        24/7 operation without days off - we are ready to provide veterinary care at any time;
        reception is by appointment, so there is enough time for the patient and we do not have queues;
        we have an institution of the attending physician - this means that the condition of your pet will be
        monitored
        by a
        personal veterinarian, who will know its history and will be able to take best care of the health of the
        animal;

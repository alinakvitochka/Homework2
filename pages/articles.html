        <h2>Leptospirosis</h2>
        <p>Leptospirosis is an acute disease of mammals and humans. The disease can be transmitted by direct contact
            with the urine of infected animals or through contaminated environmental objects, especially in high
            humidity or in places with stagnant water. Leptospires are able to penetrate through mucous membranes and
            damaged skin. They multiply in the blood, epithelium of the renal tubules and liver - causing damage to many
            organs, especially the kidneys and liver.

        <p>A number of associated vaccines have been developed for the specific prevention of leptospirosis in dogs.
            For passive immunization, hyperimmune serums are used, which protect animals from infection for two weeks.
            To prevent leptospirosis in humans, veterinary center doctors recommend:
            1. vaccinate your pets on time
            2. start treatment as early as possible if the animal is sick
            3. observe personal hygiene measures when interacting with a sick dog
        <p>

        <p>If leptospirosis is confirmed by a laboratory (serology) in your pet, do not panic - seek help from
            well-established veterinary centers, today this diagnosis is no longer a death sentence.</p>
        <h3>Helminthiasis</h3>
        <p>Helminthiasis is a disease of humans and animals caused by parasitic worms, helminths. Unfortunately, a large
            percentage of pets living with us are carriers of helminths and are capable of transmitting them to us.
            After all, we often “eat from the same bowl” with them, and children are generally all licked in the
            emotions of joy from a common game. The risk of carrying helminths is much higher in dogs that like to pick
            up everything on the street, that suffer from coprophagia, and cats that catch mice.

        <p> To treat and prevent helminthiasis, it is necessary to:
        <p>1. maintain personal hygiene</p>
        <p>2.carry out antihelminthic treatment for yourself and your pets (every 3 months)</p>
